**Objective/Deliverables:**
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset using Javascript and html

Background:
In January 2011, the Belly Button Biodiversity initiative commenced to investigate the microbes living in our navels and the factors influencing the microscopic life in this protected, moist area of skin. Using the 16S rRNA genes found in microbial swab samples, the NC State Public Science Lab tracked these molecular "fingerprints" to identify and document the multitude of species found in test subjects' navels.
